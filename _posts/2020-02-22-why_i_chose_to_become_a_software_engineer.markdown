In our youth, many of us have a talent or a passion that gives us some direction on which career path we will choose to pursue. I personally never had a clear calling so when i graduated high school, I left for college in hopes that i would find direction there. After 3 years into my Psychology major at the University of Northern Colorado, I still wasnt confident that I was in a field that that would be fulfilling and worth the expense so I chose to drop out and take some time to figure out what my next move would be.

It was by complete chance that I was hired as a security officer stationed at a Technology and Engineering Center. Working with engineers and developers everyday sparked my interest in tech and ultimately lead to me applying for Flatiron School and getting accepted. At 25 years old, I have finally found a field that i am genuinely interested in pursuing and being a part of. As a woman in tech, I will have the opportunity to influence others and contribute to change by adding more diversity to the industry. I know that I have a ton to learn and a lot of long nights ahead of me but i have no doubt that this program is a step in the right direction.
